    "- Reasons for (almost) no URLs\n",
    "    - bot detection (bisnis.com) (Crawler uses puppeteer (now with stealth plugin), cookiehunter uses selenium with xfvb)\n",
    "    - direct redirection: (ziprecruiter.com) (Cookiehunter and crawler use a different site name, thus the crawler does not crawl)\n",
    "    - TLS errors (geekbuying.com, takungpao.com) (Cookiehunter ignores cert errors, the crawler does not (as a normal? user would also not ignore them)\n",
    "    - unclear (appbrain.com, ...) (maybe timeout due to blocked or rate-limited, ...)\n",
    "- Reasons for (almost) no URLs after pruning (if many URLs were found)\n",
    "    - login area is separate from logout area and was not found (builderall.com)\n",
    "    - timeout on homepage means only homepage got crawled, and the hompage is static (deliverr.com)\n",
    "    - no differences for logged in users/no real logged in content or not much (ontvtime.ru, adtarget.com.tr, motorplus-online.com), ...\n",
    "    - cookie session sharing was not successful, thus both accounts are in the \"same\" state: (?)\n",
    "    - investigate: other reasons\n",
    "- Reasons for (big) differences between chrome/firefox: check hinative.com, moneyforward.com, flipboard.com, dn.se, etc!\n",
    "    - Why does it only work in firefox (samesite default?), why does it only work in chrome? (no idea)\n",
    "        - log-in/cookie-session-sharing did not work in one browser only\n",
    "           - probably what happend on hinative.com firefox\n",
    "           - probably what happend on flipboard.com chrome\n",
    "        - samesite not set, different defaults in browsers\n",
    "           - if only window.open works in chrome, in firefox also other leak type works (e.g., moneyforward.com), probably the case\n",
    "           - only because the session cookies are lax this does not mean nothing can leak, other cookies can also leak user info (what settings a user has)\n",
    "        - FP in one browser only (by chance):\n",
    "            - postMessage FPs? only one one site for some reason: firefox received the same pMs often for the states, chrome did not (e.g., dn.se); In general a problem? Just checking 2 times might not be enough for pMs..., exclude ones with two low jaro distance? or with both values occuring for both value_cookies, value_no_cookies on different URLs\n",
    "        - Differences in methods/parsing of browsers (e.g., in tarafdari.com):\n",
    "            - CORB makes some leaks work/not work in Chrome\n",
    "            - media_error only works in chrome\n",
    "            - nosniff is different in both browsers (e.g., firefox fires error event, chrome load event on nosniff responses to script tags), ...\n",
    "    - ~~Why does image never works? (in chrome not tested as it is the same as embed-img?), but in firefox?~~ Works but only very rarely\n",
    "    -\n",
    "- State-Differences\n",
    "    - we have logged-in account (usually nothing done), and logged-out account (at the beginning even unvisited)\n",
    "    - diff does not have to be logged-in/logged-out\n",
    "    - can also be cookie policy consented/cookie policy not consented\n",
    "    - specific user/not specific user\n",
    "    - (user with add blocker, user without ad blocker)\n",
    "    - user with \"urgent\" task, user without\n",
    "        - e.g., hinative/general if frame_count of value_cookies is 0 and value_no_cookies is N: user with urgent task is redirected to another page (e.g., some survey necessary after registration/login), another reason for this can be that logged-in users are ad-free\n",
    "- ~~Redo groupon.com to betterteam.com: problem db-server had an error/db was incorrect~~\n",
